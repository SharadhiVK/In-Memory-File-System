# In-Memory File System

An in-memory file system implementation supporting various functionalities, including directory navigation, file operations, and a bonus feature for saving and loading the file system state.

## Overview

This project implements a simple in-memory file system in [Python](https://www.python.org/) to mimic basic terminal-like commands for file and directory manipulation.

## Functionalities Implemented

- **mkdir:** Create a new directory.
- **cd:** Change the current directory.
- **ls:** List the contents of the current or specified directory.
- **grep:** Search for a specified pattern in a file (bonus feature).
- **cat:** Display the contents of a file.
- **touch:** Create a new empty file.
- **echo:** Write text to a file.
- **mv:** Move a file or directory to another location.
- **cp:** Copy a file or directory to another location.
- **rm:** Remove a file or directory.

### Bonus - Save and Reload State

- **save_state:** Save the current file system state to a file.
- **load_state:** Load the file system state from a file.
